Not sure if an AI assistant is going to be helpful in your workflow?

Don't worry, we've eliminated the guesswork for you because Gemmy is 100% going to be unhelpful.

Introducing Obsidian's first assistant - Gemmy, the Obsidian Unhelper. It has two major features:

## Randomly saying things

Gemmy seeks validation by saying randomly things every now and then.

You can customize how often this happens. Or just don't summon Gemmy.

## Writing mode

Gemmy pops out to [motivate you](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1171143/229297494-8a0cae3f-4c8e-47a9-801b-dd1c52dfc917.png) when you have stop typing for long enough. Again you can customize how long that would be.

Risk: Gemmy might actually be helpful with writing if you use this mode. We're not responsibility for any extra productivity Gemmy brings.

## How to use

Install Gemmy. There are four commands in command palette when you type "Gemmy". You can figure out the rest on your own.
